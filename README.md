This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You have to have node, and npm installed. I recommend to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), and then run ```nvm install 16``` and ```nvm use 16```
Then, go to the project location, and run ```npm install```, this should install everything needed

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

All the data needed for the website are located in ```config/index.ts```, and the components forming the pages in the ```components/``` folder
